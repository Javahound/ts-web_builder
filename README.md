# TS Web Editor
This will be a functional Online Website Editor written in TypeScript using Next.js
So far there is no Info page. To access the Editor click "Open App".
There is a simple Layout to be found. This will later be the editor for your pages. For now it does not have functionality (or even an own logo design).

## Features
None at this point. 

## Components
### This section will be added later, when screenshots are available

## Getting Started

To get started you first have to clone / fork and clone this repo.

After cloning the repository, navigate into the folder in your Terminal and run the Following command:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
